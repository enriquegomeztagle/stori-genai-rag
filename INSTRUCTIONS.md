# Stori’s Generative AI Challenge

## Welcome to the Challenge!

Hey there! We're thrilled you're interested in joining the Generative AI (GenAI) team at Stori. We’ve
put together a real-world challenge to get a glimpse of how you solve problems, make decisions, and build scalable systems using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).

## Challenge Overview

Your goal is to design and prototype a conversational agent that uses RAG and is capable of handling real-world user questions, using the provided documentation on the Mexican Revolution.

## The Scenario

You're part of a team tasked with building an internal GenAI assistant that can:

- [x] Understand questions about the shared document.

- [x] Retrieve relevant information from the internal document.

- [x] Answer follow-up questions while maintaining context.

- [ ] Support tooling or agents to extend its usefulness.

- [x] The agent must not answer questions outside the scope of the documents or its existing knowledge.

## What You'll Build

Build a working prototype of your system that:

- [x] Ingests and indexes the provided documentation.

- [x] Responds to user queries using a combination of retrieval + generation.

- [x] Maintains context for at least one follow-up question.

- [ ] Includes at least one tool that enhances functionality. (e.g. conversation summary, conversation classification, human escalation trigger).

## What to Submit

Please submit the following:

1) **Working Code**

- [ ] Source Code

- [ ] README.md file.

2) **Evaluation**

- [ ] How did you test your system?

- [ ] Any metrics you used.

We’re interested in reviewing your process for refining and tuning your RAG

3) **Infrastructure Perspective**

- [x] Submit a Dockerfile that runs your app locally.

- [ ] **_Bonus: If you can, show us how you’d deploy it to the cloud (CDK preferred)_**

4) **System Design Overview**

In 1–2 short paragraphs:

- [ ] Briefly describe your system architecture. Please include an architectural diagram to help

- [ ] What design tradeoffs or assumptions did you make?

- [ ] What would you improve if given more time?

## What We’re Looking For

We’re less interested in perfect performance and more interested in:

- [x] Your reasoning and autonomy.

- [x] Your ability to scope and solve real-world problems.

- [x] Your sense of product thinking and system design.

We hope you enjoy the challenge—and we’re excited to see how you think, build, and solve.

Good luck!
